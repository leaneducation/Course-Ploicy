Course Policy automation done by students using UiPath

This repository contains projects created by B. Tech Artificial Intelligence students of Sixth semester to automate Course Policy using UiPath.

# Overview
The aim of this project is to automate the process of creating and managing course policies using UiPath. The projects in this repository are designed to help universities and educational institutions streamline their course policy creation and management process.

The projects cover various aspects of course policy automation, including generating course objectives, categorizing course outcomes based on Bloom's Taxonomy, creating a list of recommended readings, and more.

# Projects
The following projects are included in this repository:

Course Objectives Generator
Bloom's Taxonomy Categorizer

Each project has its own folder in the repository, which contains the UiPath workflow file, documentation, and any other relevant files.

# Technologies Used
The projects in this repository are built using UiPath, a popular Robotic Process Automation (RPA) platform. UiPath provides a drag-and-drop interface for creating workflows, making it easy for non-technical users to create automation solutions.
